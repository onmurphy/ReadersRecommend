# Readers Recommend

Readers Recommend is my first app, created for the final project in Udacity's iOS Nanodegree course. 

Use Readers Recommend to search for books by isbn, then read GoodReads reviews for that book, recommend the book to friends, or add the book to your own Must Read List! 

## Instructions
Readers Recommend runs on XCode 10, Swift 2.3.
The app must be demoed on a device, as camera functionality is not available on a simulator.

## Usage
The app opens on the Must Read list. To search for a new book, select the SCAN tab bar button. You will be prompted to allow use of your camera. Click ok, then position your camera over the barcode of your book. Allow the camera to focus so it can scan the barcode. 
Readers Recommend will search Google Books for the book. 

If found, the book's image, title, and author(s) will be displayed. From this page, the user can read reviews of the users of GoodReads, or recommend to a friend by Message, Facebook, etc. Add the book to your Must Read list to save it for later.
